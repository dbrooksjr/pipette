Mint is a mod for Minecraft that adds a few **Min**or **T**weaks.

The goal of mint is to improve QOL and automation capabilities while maintaining the vanilla minecraft "feel" we all hold so dear. This is achieved by keeping things wrapped into existing core gameplay mechanics. For example, most of the crafting recipes for new blocks are composed of vanilla items (no endless "item upgrade" chains found in larger mods)
and ALL recipes have minimal levels of crafting complexity. This means you won't be crafting item A for item B for item
C for item D for item... you get it.
