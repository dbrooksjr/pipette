Pipette is the "WYSIWYG" of pipe mods!
It's also the best pipe mod available (as the developer, that statement might be a tad biased)... Give it a try and see for yourself!

Pipette's main purpose is to allow for very achievable item transfer -- no complex crafting paths, upgrades, complicated configuration options, etc.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalide/pipette/wiki) for more information, examples, and even *pictures*!

## Can/Should I use Pipette on my server?

Yes! Please do!

Do note, however, that players *will* have to have Pipette installed on their client to participate in the fun (this is inextricably unavoidable).

### What about performance?

Pipette is extremely optimized for performance. If you allow the use of Hoppers on your server, Pipette should be just fine. Pipette can actually *outperform* vanilla hoppers in many cases due to the simple nature of the pipes.

If you *do* run into performance issues while using Pipette (or any other bug for that matter), PLEASE open a GitHub issue describing your situation in detail!
